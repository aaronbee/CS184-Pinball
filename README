Our scene is a collection of objects and animations inspire by a
Sesame Street cartoon which can viewed here:

* Our scene is complete as it contains several objects from the video
  and there is very little dead space.

* The number 7 was modeled by hand.

* Just about every other object was loaded from an obj file.

* The objects have been placed by hand.

* The skybox is textured with an image read from a tga file.

* The wooden wall is also textured.

* We have several objects that are shiny like the marble and
  plunger. The foot is dull.

* GL_LIGHT0 is a directional light.

* The spinning colored lights (GL_LIGHT1 through GL_LIGHT4) are
  point lights.

* We drew four bumpers without duplicating the object.

* Pressing 'q' will toggle the plunger between filled and wireframe
  rendering.

* Just about all our objects have normals.

* Our code is based on the "Helper Code" and includes double
  buffering, hidden surface elimination, and a perspective projection.

* Pressing 'l' toggles the lights and textures between three modes:
  1. All lights and textures on.
  2. GL_LIGHT0 off which makes the other lights stand out more.
  3. All lights and textures off.

* Mouse drag and the arrow keys rotate the viewer. WASD moves the
  viewer.

* The plunger in the middle of the scene is constantly animated as
  well as the ball as long as the foot is not in the way. To toggle
  the movement of the foot press 'f'.

Extra Credit

* We have some very basic collision detection for the foot and the
  ball. If the foot is in the way of the ball, the ball will wait. If
  the foot falls on top of the ball the foot will immediately start
  going back up. The foot movement is toggled with 'f'.
